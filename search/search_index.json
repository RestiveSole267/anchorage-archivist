After the motion was approved, a search warrant for Danlabs was issued. Federal agents Stanlabs, RestiveSole267, and R21M then carried out the search warrant on August 3rd, 2020, even though it was intended for Danlabs' home, which was outside the city limits. The search warrant was still carried out, and it resulted in the agents discovering drugs evidence inside the house. Danlabs would file a trespassing lawsuit against the Town on the grounds that the government had illegally searched his home because it was outside the municipal limits, but the case would ultimately be dismissed for a lack of evidence. Danlabs would then launch a second lawsuit accusing the Town of trespassing and misusing its powers. Question Does the Town of Fairbanks have the authority to carry out search warrants outside the boundaries of the town? Has the Town of Fairbanks carried out a search warrant in disregard of the law? Conclusion The Honorable Judge ChumUnicorn64 would rule in favor of the Petitioners. According to Chum, the government has the authority to carry out a search warrant at a Fairbanks residence, but because the warrant was intended to be carried out at Danlabs' residence, which was outside the town limits, it was done so illegally. Since the government is only authorized to carry out search warrants within town limits, Chum argued that the search warrant's execution was unconstitutional.","title":"Danlabs v.
