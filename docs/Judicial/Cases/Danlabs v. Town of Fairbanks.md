### Facts of the Case
On August 2nd, 2020, The Town of Fairbanks Town Attorney DirectBuzz, would motion for a search warrant to be made out for Danlabs, a drug lord who business resides in Fairbanks. After the motion passed, the search warrant was sent out for Danlabs. On August 3rd, 2020, The search warrant was then executed by federal agents Stanlabs, RestiveSole267, and R21M; however the search warrant was meant for Danlabs' residence which was located outside of the city limits. The search warrant was still executed, and ended with the agents find evidences of drugs in the residence. Danlabs would sue the Town for trespassing on grounds that since his residence was outside of the city limit the government had unlawfully executed a search his residence, the case would be later dimissed due to lack of evidence. Danlabs would then file for another suit against the Town for trespassing and misuse of power. 

### Question
Does the Town of Fairbanks have the power to execute search warrants outside of town limits, and did the Town of Fairbanks unlawfully execute a search warrant?

### Conclusion
The Honorable Judge ChumUnicorn64 would rule in favor of the Petitioners. In Chum's opinion he argued that the government does have the power to execute search warrant on residence of Fairbanks however since the search warrant was meant for Danlabs' residence which was outside of town limit, the warrant was executed unlawfully and the government only has the power to execute search warrants in town limits therefore making the execution of the search warrant unconsitutional.
